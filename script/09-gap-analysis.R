# Gap analysis assessing the extent to which future climates
# in key production areas are represented in the international 
# collections of the 10 selected crops
# To understand differences between future climates in production areas
# and the climates represented by accessions in international collections, 
# we used the cluster classifications (genetic resources groups, hereafter) 
# developed in Task 2 as the basis, and matched the production areas to
# these groups. The analysis was performed at a chosen climate cluster 
# resolution, seeking to intersect with defined genetic groups (for landraces) 
# and genepools (for CWR). The climate matching was done using the future climate
# of the current production sample (data from Task 1). The matching was done
# based on climate similarity with a threshold (e.g., the centroid of the 
# cluster ± 2 times its standard deviation for at least 80% of the climate 
# variables) to determine when a given crop production site is ‘matched’ or 
# ‘not’ to a genetic resources group. All production sites not matched to a
# genetic resources group were analysed and plotted to understand their climate 
# characteristics and geographic distribution.
#
# Assign crop growing area sample to accession climate pools, using different 
# num of climate pools (i.e., different k cluster numbers). The matching will
# be done based on climate similarity (e.g., Mahalanobis, Gower, or Euclidean distance)
# with a threshold (e.g., the centroid of the cluster ± 2 times its standard deviation
# for at least 80% of the climate variables) to determine when a given crop production
# site is ‘matched’ or ‘not’ to a genetic resources group. Do this for (1) future 
# climate of the current production sample; and (2) future climate of the future
# production sample.
# 
# Output 1: table of accession clusters that more frequently had matching 
# crop (current, future) production area samples, produce table of means, 
# sigma, max/min, PDF plot, maps
# 
# Output 2: analyze current, future production samples that fell outside of
# accession climate pools, plot mean climate conditions, sigma, probability 
# distribution of the samples). Plot maps of where these are.
