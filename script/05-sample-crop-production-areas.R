# Draw current production sample from MapSPAM
# using relative harvested area as weight, 
# then remove any pixels that according to the suitability layers become unsuitable under 
# future climates, and add pixels that are projected to become suitable. The added pixels will 
# also be sampled, aiming to maintain the proportion between new and currently cultivated areas, 
# and the sampling weights will be the future projected suitability values. 
# first run: Feb 2024
