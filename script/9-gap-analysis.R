# To understand differences between future climates in production
# areas and the climates represented by accessions in international
# collections, we used the cluster classifications (genetic resources
# groups, hereafter) developed in Task 2 as the basis, and matched 
# the production areas to these groups. The analysis was performed at
# a chosen climate cluster resolution, seeking to intersect with defined
# genetic groups (for landraces) and genepools (for CWR). The climate 
# matching was done using the future climate of the current production 
# sample (data from Task 1). The matching was done based on climate 
# similarity with a threshold (e.g., the centroid of the cluster ± 2 
# times its standard deviation for at least 80% of the climate variables) 
# to determine when a given crop production site is ‘matched’ or ‘not’ to 
# a genetic resources group. All production sites not matched to a genetic
# resources group were analysed and plotted to understand their climate
# characteristics and geographic distribution.
